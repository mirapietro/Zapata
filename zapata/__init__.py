*Zapata*
========


A revolutionary library for analysis and plotting of meteorological data.  

The mapping is based on cartopy and GEOCAT libraries from NCAR.
It uses `xarray` as a basic data structure. 

The module `data` contains the information on the data banks. The routine `DataGrid` in `data` must be modified to the location of the basic data for each installation.

*Zapata* contains computation modules and plotting modules. Examples of working Jupyterlab Notebooks are in `docs.examples_notebook`
