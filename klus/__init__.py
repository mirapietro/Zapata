# Algorithm and utility functions for nonlinear analyses
## For Koopman and perron analysis

Based on software from Stefan Klus

Modules 
------- 
    
**algorithms** :   
    Routines for averaging and various computations.
    The implementations of the methods 
 
    - DMD, TICA, AMUSE
    - Ulam's method
    - EDMD, kernel EDMD, generator EDMD
    - SINDy
    - kernel PCA, kernel CCA
    - CMD
    - SEBA
 
are based on the publications listed here:
 
    https://github.com/sklus/d3s
    
**observables** :  
    various functions for observables

**kernels** :   
    Definition of various kernels
    
**tools** :   
    Utilties for the rest of the modules.
