# Zapata
## Computational and Mapping Library   

A revolutionary library for analysis and plotting of meteorological data. The mapping is based on cartopy and GEOCAT libraries from NCAR.
It uses `xarray` as a core data structure for all processing. 

The directory `examples_notebook` contains working Jupyter Notebooks to illustarte different applications of Zapata.

## Documentation

Zapata documentation is created using `sphinx` and it is sourced from the code itself.
To create a local copy of HTML documentation go to `docs` folder and type `gmake html`.

HTML documentation can be accessed opening the main page at `docs/build/html/index.html`

## Setup working environemt
Python working environment can be setup using the provided conda environment.yml file:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`conda activate zapata`

To update your `zapata` environment with following updates use

`conda env update -f environment.yml`
